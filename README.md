## Why This Solution Stands Out

Most civic information tools are static FAQ pages. **CivicGuide is different:**

- 🧠 **Truly personalised** — 3 onboarding questions change every screen, every message, every link
- 🤖 **Gemini AI used meaningfully** — not just chat; also generates a structured, personalised action plan unique to each user
- 🌍 **Designed as a global framework** — U.S. is the reference implementation, but the architecture adapts to any country's election system
- ⚡ **Lightweight by design** — ~60 KB of source code, zero frontend frameworks, one backend dependency
- 🔒 **Production-safe** — server-side API key, rate limiting, input validation, no client-side secrets
- 📲 **Installable PWA** — works offline for static features, installable on any device

---

## 1. Overview

### What It Does
CivicGuide guides voters through the complete election process — from registration to casting their ballot — using a personalised, conversational, step-by-step experience powered by Gemini AI.

### Problem It Solves
Voter disengagement is often not apathy — it's confusion. Millions of eligible citizens miss elections because the process feels overwhelming. CivicGuide removes that friction by breaking the journey into 4 clear stages, adapting to each user's exact situation, and answering their specific questions instantly.

### Real-World Usefulness
- Works on any device with a browser, including low-end mobile phones
- No account, no downloads, no personal data collected
- Fully functional without an API key (guide, maps, timeline all work offline-capable)
- Onboarding takes under 30 seconds

### Global Applicability
The current implementation covers the **U.S. election system** as a reference model. The architecture is intentionally modular: the `STEPS` and `TIMELINE` data arrays in `app.js` can be swapped for any country's election stages, and the Gemini system prompt can be re-targeted to any jurisdiction. A future `country` field in the user profile would make this a truly global civic tool.

## 2. Key Features

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| **User Profiling Quiz** | 3 questions (first-time voter, registration status, location) that personalise every panel |
| **4-Step Election Guide** | Register → Verify → Choose Voting Method → Election Day, with curated actions and links |
| **AI Personal Action Plan** | Gemini generates a structured JSON checklist unique to each user's profile |
| **Multi-Turn AI Chat** | Gemini 1.5 Flash with full conversation memory, topic-matched follow-up suggestions |
| **Election Timeline** | 7 milestones with urgency badges and Google Calendar deep-links |

| **Graceful Degradation** | All non-AI features work without a Gemini API key |

---

## 3. Intelligent Decision Engine

The decision engine runs at `launchApp()` and branches in three dimensions simultaneously:

### Dimension 1 — First-Time Voter (`firstTime`)
```
firstTime = "yes"
  → Show gold first-timer welcome banner
  → Chat greeting: "I can see you're a first-time voter in [location]"
  → Every step tip box emphasises simplicity ("under 5 minutes", "all you need is...")
  → AI plan prompt instructs Gemini to treat user as a complete beginner

firstTime = "no"
  → Standard experience, no extra scaffolding
```

### Dimension 2 — Registration Status (`registered`)
```
registered = "no"
  → Show red urgent alert: "You're not registered yet!"
  → Direct link to vote.gov prominent on Step 1
  → AI plan `priority` field set to registration as the #1 action
  → Step 1 opened by default

registered = "yes"
  → Step 1 still covers address updates and verification
  → No urgent alert shown
```

### Dimension 3 — Location (`location`)
```
location provided
  → Maps search pre-filled with state/city
  → Google Polling Finder link deep-linked: ?q=polling+place+near+[location]
  → Timeline note: "Verify exact dates for [location] at vote.gov"
  → Gemini API calls include location in profile context

location skipped
  → Generic U.S. messaging throughout
  → User can still search manually in Maps tab
```

All three dimensions are evaluated independently and combined — a first-time, unregistered voter in California gets a maximally guided, urgency-first experience, while a returning registered voter who skips location gets a streamlined verification-focused flow.

## 4. How It Works

```
STEP 1 · WELCOME
User sees the welcome screen with animated background.
New user → "Get Started" | Returning user → "Resume My Guide" (profile from localStorage)

STEP 2 · PROFILING QUIZ (30 seconds)
  Q1: First-time voter? [Yes / No]          → state.profile.firstTime
  Q2: Registration status? [Yes / Unsure]   → state.profile.registered
  Q3: Location? (optional free text)        → state.profile.location
  Each answer auto-advances after 300ms visual confirmation.

STEP 3 · DECISION ENGINE RUNS
  launchApp() reads all 3 profile values and:
  - Shows/hides contextual banners
  - Pre-fills Maps and Finder links
  - Personalises Timeline note
  - Triggers AI Action Plan generation via POST /api/plan

STEP 4 · MAIN APP (4 tabs)

  📋 GUIDE
  4 step cards rendered from STEPS[] data array.
  Step dots: grey (upcoming) → blue (active) → green ✓ (done)
  Below all steps: AI-generated personal action plan card.
  Completing Step 4 → confetti + "Go Vote!" modal.

  💬 ASK AI
  Gemini 1.5 Flash chat with full conversation memory.
  Every POST /api/chat includes: message + profile context + full chat history.
  Bot responses include topic-matched follow-up suggestion pills.

  📅 TIMELINE
  7 static milestones rendered with urgency badges.
  Each milestone has a Google Calendar pre-fill deep-link.

  📍 FIND POLLS
  Google Official Polling Finder button (pre-linked to user location).
  Embedded Google Maps iframe loads on search or geolocation.
  "My Location" uses browser Geolocation API.

STEP 5 · SESSION SAVED
Every profile change, step advance, and chat message is saved to localStorage.
```

## 5. System Architecture

```
Browser                          Express Server              Google APIs
──────────────────────────────   ─────────────────────────   ──────────────────
index.html (SPA shell)      │
style.css  (design system)  ├──► POST /api/chat ──────────► Gemini 1.5 Flash
app.js     (state machine)  │    POST /api/plan ──────────► Gemini 1.5 Flash
manifest.json + sw.js (PWA) │
                            │    Rate limiter: 20 req/60s
                            │    API key: server-side only
                            │    Input: validated + sanitised
                            │
                            ├──► GET  /health (status check)
                            └──► GET  *       (SPA fallback)

Maps/Calendar/Finder: direct browser deep-links (no backend involved)
```

**State management:** Single `state` object in `app.js` IIFE — mutated in place, mirrored to `localStorage` on every update. No framework, no store library.

## 7. Google Services Integration

| Service | Integration | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| **Gemini 1.5 Flash** | Server-side REST proxy `/api/chat` + `/api/plan` | Multi-turn AI chat + personalised structured action plan |
| **Google Maps Embed** | `<iframe src="maps.google.com/maps?q=...">` | Polls polling stations near any searched address |
| **Google Maps Geolocation** | Browser `navigator.geolocation` → Maps iframe URL | Auto-centres map on user's physical location |
| **Google Search Civic Data** | Deep-link `google.com/search?q=polling+place+near+[location]` | Google's real-time official polling place data |
| **Google Calendar** | Deep-link `calendar.google.com/render?action=TEMPLATE` | Pre-fills election deadlines for one-click calendar adds |
| **Google Fonts** | CDN `<link>` — Inter typeface | Accessible, professional typography |

**Security:** `GEMINI_API_KEY` is an environment variable on the server only. It is never sent to the browser, never logged, and never included in any client response.

---

## 8. Accessibility Considerations

| Principle | Implementation |
|---|---|
| **Plain language** | All copy written at grade 8 reading level; zero jargon |
| **Mobile-first** | Fully responsive; tested at 375px (iPhone SE) and 1440px |
| **ARIA semantics** | `role="tablist"`, `aria-selected`, `aria-live`, `aria-label` throughout |
| **Keyboard navigation** | All interactive elements are `<button>` or `<a>` — fully focusable |
| **Colour contrast** | Dark background (#0a0d14) with high-contrast text (#f1f5f9) |
| **Auto-advancing quiz** | 300ms delay before advancing — prevents accidental skips |
| **Error states** | All API failures show friendly, actionable messages |
| **Focus management** | Panels switch without losing scroll context |
| **No time pressure** | Users can take as long as needed on any step |

> **Known gap:** A full WCAG 2.1 AA audit (screen reader testing, focus ring visibility) is listed as a future improvement.

---

## 9. Security Considerations

| Area | Measure |
|---|---|
| **API key exposure** | `GEMINI_API_KEY` stored in server env only — never sent to browser |
| **Rate limiting** | In-memory limiter: 20 requests / 60 seconds / IP, with automatic stale-entry cleanup |
| **Input validation** | Server validates `message` field is present and non-empty before any Gemini call |
| **No PII stored** | No user account, no database, no server-side session — profile lives in client `localStorage` only |
| **Content policy** | Gemini system prompt explicitly prohibits partisan content and candidate endorsements |
| **iframe sandboxing** | Maps iframe uses `referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade"` and `loading="lazy"` |
| **Dependency surface** | One production dependency (`express`) — minimal attack surface |
| **Error messages** | Server errors return generic messages; raw Gemini errors are never forwarded to the client |

**Recommended additional hardening (post-hackathon):**
- Add `helmet.js` for HTTP security headers
- Implement CORS origin allowlist for production
- Add request body size limit (`express.json({ limit: '4kb' })`)

| Add deadline | Click "📅 Add to Calendar" on any timeline item |
| Find polling place | Type address or click "📍 My Location" in the Find Polls tab |
| Start over | Click "↺ Restart" in the top nav bar |

---

## 13. Design Decisions & Assumptions

| Decision | Rationale |
|---|---|
| **No frontend framework** | Eliminates build toolchain; reduces total size to ~60 KB; faster cold start |
| **IIFE module pattern** | All state is private; no global pollution; easy to reason about |
| **Profile injected into every Gemini call** | Ensures AI responses are always contextually relevant, not generic |
| **`localStorage` for persistence** | No backend DB needed; works offline; GDPR-friendly (no server-side PII) |
| **Two Gemini endpoints** | Separates concerns: chat is conversational, plan is structured — different temperature and token limits |
| **Static timeline data** | Avoids live API dependency; generalised U.S. dates are accurate year-round |
| **In-memory rate limiter** | Production safety with zero extra packages |
| **Graceful no-key mode** | Maximises usability for evaluators without API access |

**Key assumptions:**
- Users are on modern browsers (ES6+ support)
- Target is English-speaking U.S. voters for v1
- Users may be on slow mobile connections — heavy assets avoided

---

## 14. Limitations

| Limitation | Impact |
|---|---|
| Timeline dates are approximate ("~30 days before") | Not tied to any specific election calendar |
| Google Maps iframe uses undocumented embed URL | Long-term stability risk; should migrate to Maps Embed API v2 |
| No live election data | Dates don't update automatically for upcoming elections |
| English only | Non-English speakers not served |
| No multi-device sync | `localStorage` is device-specific |
| PWA icons not resized server-side | Both icon files are the same image at different declared sizes |
| No WCAG 2.1 AA audit | ARIA labels present but screen reader testing not completed |

---

## 15. Future Improvements

| Priority | Improvement |
|---|---|
| 🔴 | **Google Civic Information API** — real state-specific election dates, officials, polling places |
| 🔴 | **Gemini streaming** (SSE) — word-by-word response for better chat UX |
| 🟡 | **Firebase Firestore** — cross-device session sync and analytics |
| 🟡 | **Multi-language support** — Gemini handles translation natively; add `lang` to profile |
| 🟡 | **Country selector** — make the global framework user-facing |
| 🟡 | **`helmet.js`** — HTTP security headers for production hardening |
| 🟢 | **Push notifications** — deadline reminders via Web Push API |
| 🟢 | **WCAG 2.1 AA audit** — full screen reader and keyboard navigation review |
| 🟢 | **Proper icon pipeline** — generate 192px/512px icons from SVG at build time |

---

## 16. Conclusion

CivicGuide demonstrates that **AI can meaningfully improve civic participation** — not by replacing human judgment, but by removing the friction that prevents people from showing up to vote.

It is:
- **Genuinely useful** — solves a real problem for millions of eligible voters
- **Technically sound** — clean architecture, production-safe, one-command deployable
- **AI-first, not AI-gimmick** — Gemini is used for both conversational guidance and structured personalisation
- **Designed to scale** — the framework adapts to any country's election system with minimal changes
- **Lightweight by principle** — ~60 KB of source code, zero frameworks, fully functional offline
